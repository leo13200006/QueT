# QueT : Takes a long queue online. Makes social distancing possible. 

The app is called 'QueT'. It is a online token based solution for handling long waiting queues at
shops. Recently there were many violations in social distancing of people standing in queue
when wine shops were allowed to operate.

We take the complete queue online on our app. So people can join the queue from their home
and arrive at the shop only once their token is about to arrive.

With minimum contact with strangers you can visit a shop which for example has 100 people in
the queue. Thus it is possible to follow social distancing even in such a long queue because you
arrive at the shop only when it&#39;s your turn shortly.

The shopkeeper calls in the next person from our app with the press of a button depending on
the people he can handle without compromising on social distancing.
